  <p>The technique of Vippassana is a simple , practical way to achieve real peace of mind to lead a happy , useful life .Vippassana means to see things as they really are,its a logical process of mental purification through self observation.</p>
  <p>From time to time we all experience agitation ,frustration and disharmony.When we suffer,we do not keep our misery limited to ourselves;instead ,we keep distributing it to others .Certainly this is not a proper way to live .We all long to live at peace witin ourselves ,and with those ariund us .After all ,human beings are social beings:we have to live and interact with other . How , than can we live peacefully ? How can we remain harmonious ourselves , and maintain peace and harmony around? </p>
  <p>Vipassana enables us to experience peace and harmony : it purifies the mind , freeing it from suffering and the deep-seated causes of suffering . The practice leads step by step to the highest spiritual goal of full liberation from all mental defilements </p>
  <h4>Historical Background:</h4>
  <p>Vipassana is one of India's most ancient meditation techniques .It was rediscovered 2600 years ago by Gotama the Buddha,and is the existence of what he practiced and taught during his fourty-five year ministry . During the Buddha's time ,large numbers of people in northern India were freed from the bonds of suffering  by practising Vipassana , allowing them to attain high levels of achievement in all spheres of life . Over time , the techinque spread to the neighbouring countries of Burma ,SriLanka,Thailand and others,where it had the same ennobling effect.</p>
<p>Five centuries after the Buddha ,the nobble heritage of Vipassana had disappeared from India . The purity of the teaching was lost elsewhere as well .In the country of Burma ,however it was preserved by a chain of devoted teachers.From generation to generation,over two thousand years,this dedicated lineage transmitted the technique in its pristine purity.</p>
<p>In our time,Vipaassana has been reintroduced to India,as well as to citizens from other countries by Shri S.N. Goenka.Goenkaji was authorized to teach Vipassana by th renowed Burmese Vipassana teacher,Sayagyi U Ba Khin.Before he died in 1971,Sayagyi was able to see one of his most cherished dreams realized.He had the strong wish that Vipassana should return to India,the land of origin ,to help it come out of its manifold problems.From India </p>
